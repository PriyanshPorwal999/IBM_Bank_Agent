## ü§ñ Watson AI Assessment Logic

### **Rule-Based Fallback System**
When Watson AI is unavailable, the system uses intelligent rule-based assessment:

```python
# Age Requirements
if age < 21: status = 'REJECTED' (Below minimum age)
if age > 65: status = 'REJECTED' (Above maximum age)

# Income Assessment
if annual_income < 300000: status = 'REJECTED' (Below ‚Çπ3L minimum)

# Loan-to-Income Ratio
if (loan_amount / annual_income) > 5: status = 'CONDITIONAL' (High ratio)

# CIBIL Score Analysis
if cibil_score < 550: status = 'REJECTED'
if cibil_score < 650: status = 'CONDITIONAL'
if cibil_score >= 650: status = 'APPROVED'
```

### **Dynamic Document Requirements**
AI determines documents based on:
- **Loan Type**: Home (property docs), Car (vehicle docs), Education (admission docs)
- **Employment Type**: Salaried (salary slips, Form 16) vs Self-employed (ITR, business docs)
- **Risk Level**: Higher risk requires additional documentation
